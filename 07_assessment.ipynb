    "Congratulations on going through today's course! Hopefully you've learned some valuable skills along the way. Now it's time to put those skills to the test. In this assessment you will train a new model that is able to recognize fresh and rotten fruit. You will need to get the model to a validation accuracy of 92% in order to pass the assessment, though we challenge you to do even better if you can. You will have the use the skills that you learned in the previous exercises. Specifically we suggest you use some combination of transfer learning, data augmentation, and fine tuning. Once you have trained the model to be at least 92% accurate on the test dataset, you will save your model, and then assess its accuracy. Let's get started! "

The dataset comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sriramr/fruits-fresh-and-rotten-for-classification), a great place to go if you're interested in starting a project after this class. If you'd like, you can look at the dataset structure in the `fruits` folder. There are 6 categories of fruits: fresh apples, fresh oranges, fresh bananas, rotten apples, rotten oranges, and rotten bananas. This will mean that your model will require an output layer of 6 neurons to do the categorization successfully. You'll also need to compile the model with `categorical_crossentropy`, as we have more than two categories."
